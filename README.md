This project aims to explore the application of the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in healthcare diagnostics through data and statistical analysis. ELISA is a widely used biochemical technique for detecting antibodies, antigens, proteins, and hormones in biological samples. 
The project will analyze ELISA-derived data to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and clinical relevance in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and research.ELISA is a commonly used laboratory test to detect antibodies in the blood. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances, called antigens. In this project you will learn how to download, prepare and make statistical analysis of ELISA tests and collected information about IgG and IgM, vaccination influenza, vaccination tuberculosis and other diseases and blood groups.
